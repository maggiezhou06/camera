# Camera Project
At&t basic intern project
## About this project
* Camera App that allows you to upload images taken from the browser onto an AWS cloud server using Javascript and Html.
* There are 3 main pages: login, camera, and gallery.
* Users must make an account in order to login to this app and upload their snapshots.
* Users will be stored in a listOfUsers table in a MySQL camera database.
* Camera is built using WebRTC.
* The gallery page displays all of the images under the user's account. Here the user can select images to be deleted.
* The snapshots taken with this camera will be used to collect data for AI facial recognition training.
## Security
* To maintain security and privacy, the ubuntu webpack server cannot directly access content from the second ubuntu server. In order get this data and reach the other server, a proxy is used as a gateway.
* A JSON web token is assigned to the user after login. The user cannot upload any images to the server if the token is not verified first.
* A short lived string token attached to the end of the img.src call that must be authenticated in the second ubuntu server in order to gain access to images in the gallery. This ensures that image files cannot be reached directly through the serverâ€™s url, even if the user happens to know exact file directories.

## Project setup

### Set up two ubuntu servers from AWS
* webpack
  * replace (input_public/private_ip_of_your_ubuntu_webpack_server_here) throughout code with your own AWS information
* node js and mysql
  * replace (input_public_ip_of_your_ubuntu_server2_here) throughout code with your own AWS information

### Generate SSL Certificate Webpack
#### Generate private key
openssl genrsa -out private.key 4096
#### Signing request
openssl req -new -sha256 \
    -out private.csr \
    -key private.key \
    -config ssl.conf 
#### Generate certificate
openssl x509 -req \
    -days 3650 \
    -in private.csr \
    -signkey private.key \
    -out private.crt \
    -extensions req_ext \
    -extfile ssl.conf
#### Add to keychain and trust certificate
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain private.crt
#### Create pem file from certificate
openssl x509 -in private.crt -out private.pem -outform PEM

### MySQL setup
CREATE TABLE `listOfUsers` (
  `ID` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `First_Name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `Last_Name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `Username` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `Password` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `Email` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`ID`),
  UNIQUE KEY `Username` (`Username`),
  UNIQUE KEY `Email` (`Email`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=6 DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;
